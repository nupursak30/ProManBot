# ProManBot - Project Management Bot

The project deals with development of a bot that enhances the Project Management Lifecycle experience by providing automation for certain crucial steps such as creation of different tasks within projects, tracking task status for the project manager/individual team member as well as sending notifications about the pending and the completed tasks to the project manager and the individual team member. In this project, the project manager and the team member will interact with the Bot, which in turn will interact with the Trello's API for doing project management effectively.
